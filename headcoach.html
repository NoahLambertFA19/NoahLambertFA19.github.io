    <h1>Kliff Kingsbury, Head Coach</h1>

   <IMG SRC="kliff.jpg" height="250" width="400">

   <p>Last year the Cardinals had Steve Wilks as a head coach, but after an awful first year, Wilks was fired and Arizona hired Kliff Kingsbury.  Kingsbury was brought on because the team knew they would be drafting Kyler Murray, and they knew that Kyler would run Kingsbury's air raid offense the most effectively.  Kingsbury was the head coach at Texas Tech before joining Arizona.</p>
