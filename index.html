<p>Welcome to my Website! I am a sophomore at UMaine studying marketing.  However, this website will be about my favorite NFL team, the Arizona Cardinals.  Most people don't have any idea why they're my favorite team and it's because when I first started following the NFL, they were my favorite to watch and they still are.</p>
